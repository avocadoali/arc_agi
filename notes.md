The input is a grid of numbers where all cells are either 0 (empty) or 3. The output is similar to the input, but some of the 3s have been replaced with 4s. This transformation is occurring only in certain areas of the grid, and these areas seem to be related to the pattern of 3s in the grid. Let's carefully reason through the transformation rule based on the given examples and additional input.

1. Observe the changes from input to output for each of the given examples.
   - In example 1, the top and bottom 3s of the purple rectangle are changed to 4s.
   - In example 2, the top left and bottom left 3s of the purple rectangle are changed to 4s.
   - In example 3, all of the top, bottom, and side 3s of the purple rectangle are changed to 4s.
   - In example 4, all of the top and bottom 3s of the purple rectangle are changed to 4s.
   - In example 5, all of the top and bottom 3s of the smaller purple rectangles and the top and bottom 3s of the larger purple rectangle are changed to 4s.

2. Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves changing the 3s on the top, bottom, and sides of the purple rectangles to 4s.

3. Now, let's consider the additional input and apply the same rule to determine what the output should be.
   - The top row has a 3, which should be changed to a 4.
   - The second row has a 3, which should be changed to a 4.
   - The third row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The fourth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The fifth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The sixth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The seventh row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The eighth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The ninth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The tenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The eleventh row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The twelfth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The thirteenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The fourteenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The fifteenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The sixteenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The seventeenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The eighteenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The nineteenth row has 3s on the left and right, which should be changed to 4s.
   - The twentieth row has a 3, which should be changed to a 4.

4. We can implement this rule in the code using numpy to make the replacements in the grid.
   - We'll iterate over the rows and columns of the grid and check if the current cell is a 3.
   - If it is, we'll check if it's on the top, bottom, or sides of a purple rectangle.
   - If it is, we'll change it to a 4.

Now, let's implement this in the code.

import numpy as np

def transform(grid_lst: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    grid = np.array(grid_lst)

    min_row, min_col = np.min(purple_shapes, axis=0)

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- The purple rectangle in the middle has a changed shape.
- The top left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The top right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The new shape is a square.

The input for example 1:

- It has a purple rectangle in the middle.
- It has a square shape in each corner of the purple rectangle.

In example 2:

- The purple rectangle in the middle has a changed shape.
- The top left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The top right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The new shape is a square.

The input for example 2:

- It has a purple rectangle in the middle.
- It has a square shape in each corner of the purple rectangle.

In example 3:

- The purple rectangle in the middle has a changed shape.
- The top left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The top right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The new shape is a square.

The input for example 3:

- It has a purple rectangle in the middle.
- It has a square shape in each corner of the purple rectangle.

In example 4:

- The purple rectangle in the middle has a changed shape.
- The top left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The top right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The new shape is a square.

The input for example 4:

- It has a purple rectangle in the middle.
- It has a square shape in each corner of the purple rectangle.

In example 5:

- The purple rectangle in the middle has a changed shape.
- The top left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The top right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The new shape is a square.

The input for example 5:

- It has a purple rectangle in the middle.
- It has a square shape in each corner of the purple rectangle.

In the additional input:

- The purple rectangle in the middle has a changed shape.
- The top left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The top right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom left corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The bottom right corner of the purple rectangle has a new shape.
- The new shape is a square.

Given these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:

1. Identify the purple rectangle in the middle.
2. Identify the square shape in each corner of the purple rectangle.
3. Replace each square shape in the corner of the purple rectangle with a new square shape.

The transformation rule involves changing the color of some cells in the grid. The transformation rule will be applied to all the cells in the grid.

Let's examine the changes in the examples to infer the transformation rule:

In example 1:
- A new orange (color 4) cell is added in the middle.

In example 2:
- Two new orange cells are added in the middle.

In example 3:
- Four new orange cells are added in the middle.

In example 4:
- Two new orange cells are added in the middle.

In example 5:
- Four new orange cells are added in the middle.

In all of the examples, it appears that the new orange (color 4) cells are being added to the middle section of the grid. The middle section can be defined as the cells that are surrounded by cells with the same color.

Let's define the transformation rule:

1. Identify the middle section of the grid.
2. Add a new orange (color 4) cell to the middle section of the grid.
3. If there are multiple middle sections, add an orange cell to each middle section.

Now let's implement this in the code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- The input has a 3x3 grid with the shape 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0.
- The input has one 3 on the top row, one 3 on the second row, one 3 on the third row, and the rest of the grid is 0.
- The output has a 4 replacing the 3 on the top row, a 4 replacing the 3 on the second row, and the rest of the grid remains the same.

In example 2:

- The input has a 3x3 grid with the shape 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.
- The input has one 3 on the top row, one 3 on the second row, one 3 on the third row, and the rest of the grid is 0.
- The output has a 4 replacing the 3 on the top row, a 4 replacing the 3 on the second row, and a 4 replacing the 3 on the third row.

In example 3:

- The input has a 3x3 grid with the shape 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 0 3.
- The input has one 3 on the top row, one 3 on the second row, one 3 on the third row, and the rest of the grid is 0.
- The output has a 4 replacing the 3 on the top row, a 4 replacing the 3 on the second row, and a 4 replacing the 3 on the third row.

In example 4:

- The input has a 3x3 grid with the shape 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.
- The input has one 3 on the top row, one 3 on the second row, one 3 on the third row, and the rest of the grid is 0.
- The output has a 4 replacing the 3 on the top row, a 4 replacing the 3 on the second row, and a 4 replacing the 3 on the third row.

In example 5:

- The input has a 3x3 grid with the shape 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.
- The input has one 3 on the top row, one 3 on the second row, one 3 on the third row, and the rest of the grid is 0.
- The output has a 4 replacing the 3 on the top row, a 4 replacing the 3 on the second row, and a 4 replacing the 3 on the third row.

Given these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:

1. Identify a 3x3 grid with the shape 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.
2. Look for 3s in the 3x3 grid.
3. For each 3 found in the 3x3 grid, replace it with a 4.

LOGGER: LLM RESPONSE to result grids: <reasoning>
The outputs have rows and columns of 3's with single 3's around the grid by taking some paths in the input grids.

In example 1:
- The top and bottom edges of the 3 are extended to make a taller 3 with a path of 3's connecting the top and bottom to each other and the central 3.
- The left and right edges of the 3 are extended to make a wider 3 with a path of 3's connecting the left and right to each other and the central 3.

Example 2 has the same changes, just in the context of a larger grid.

Example 3 has the same changes, again in the context of a larger grid.

Example 4 has the same changes, but the grid is larger and there are more rows and columns of 3's. It seems each additional row and column is added by splitting some groups of 3's into two separate rows of 3's.

Example 5 is similar, but more complicated. 
- We extend the rows and columns the same way, except for the top and bottom edges of the 3.
- For the top and bottom edges, we do something different. 
- We take the largest group of vertical 3's, let's call it group 1, and extend it as the top edge for the 3. 
- We increment the color change by adding a color change in the first group of vertical 3's that are not part of group 1. 
- We then find the lower vertical group of 3's that is connected to group 1. 
- We increment the color change by adding a color change in that group of 3's.
- We repeat this process of incrementing the color change in the new group and then finding the lower group of 3's that is connected to the new group. 
- This process goes on until we reach the bottom 3. 
- For the bottom 3, we increment the color change in the first group of 3's that do not overlap with the highest group of vertical 3's that extends the bottom edge of the 3.

Now, for the guess grid, we can apply this same approach to generate a transformation rule and implement it in the code.

LOGGER: LLM RESPONSE to result grids: <reasoning>
The inputs are 2D grids with the same dimension. The grid cells have two possible values 0 and 3. 0 represents the background and 3 represents the shape.

In every output, grids with value 0 or 3 are unchanged.

In examples 1 to 5, the grid is transformed as follows:

1. For every grid cell (i,j) having value 3, the entire row's grid cells are incremented. If (i,j) is the smallest j, the first column of the entire row is kept unchanged.
2. If a column is fully transformed, each grid cell value in that column is added by the index of the column.

These transformation steps can also be applied to the additional input grid.

Now let's implement these steps in the code.

LOGGER: LLM RESPONSE to result grids: <reasoning>

The description explains that a single color appears in each input and this color is different in each input. This is not obvious from just the images, so this additional information helps. You are also told the rectangles are of different sizes. There is a similar number of cells in each of the rectangles. Exactly what types of edits were made isn't obvious. It isn't a simple case of changing cells or any particular repeating pattern. The transformation rule also isn't obvious from the inputs and outputs.

The transformation rule is that for each rectangle, new rectangles are inserted into the shape which match the original shape's color and insert them in a spiral. There are four cells of this shape for the purple input and 2 cells each for the blue and yellow inputs. The rectangle has four colored cells.

I've inferred this because the new cells inserted are always purple, blue, or yellow. They are always in the shape of a rectangle with 4 colored cells. They always appear in a spiral pattern within the original shape. It is also impossible for the original shapes to be as large as the transformation would allow, so there is no ambiguity about which cell to replace. If the original shape was large enough, there would be ambiguity whether the new cells were added clockwise or counterclockwise.

The new color inserted corresponds to the input's color. The inputs were purple, blue, and yellow. The outputs were also purple, blue, and yellow, respectively.

Each new rectangle is of the same shape as the original rectangle. They all have 4 colored cells. The new rectangles also have the same side lengths as the original rectangles.

I can only see one rectangule per color in the output, but I do not know if there could be more. For example, I don't know if there could be two purple rectangles in the output for the purple input.

I will now implement this rule in the code.
